This was my second front-end project for Code Factory and uses HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

**Note: Not all of the links and buttons are active, as this was not the goal of the project. Only the "Up Priority", "Lower Priority" and "Sort tasks by priority" buttons are active.

Please note I have kept the projects exactly as they were when I first created them, not enhancing or beautifying them in any way so that progress can be seen from project 1 to project 3.
